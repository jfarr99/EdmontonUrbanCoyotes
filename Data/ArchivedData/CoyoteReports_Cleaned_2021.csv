I froze, it locked eye contact with me, and starred at me until i moved to take a step forward (I planned to continue walking, slowly, without turning my back to it, keep eye contact). When I moved it ran on someones lawn and ran around for a bit, before it went to the road and ran down 78 avenue, away from me. It stopped on another persons lawn about a block away, but a group of 3 people with a dog started to approach (they didnt see the coyote yet) and that startled the coyote, so it ran away down 116 street and it disappeared out of sight. I was scared at first because we were just starring at eachother and it wasnt moving, very unpredictable. But once I started walking away, it ran away immediately so I think it mightve been scared, plus it had the same reaction with the other people, as soon as the coyote noticed them approaching it ran away.

My older one was quiet as she never barks unless someone is in the yard but she was prepared to stand her ground when one of the two coyotes started a hunt posture and moved towards us. I grabbed both of our dogs under my arms and the coyote stopped advancing but still had ears down back. I yelled at them and they didn&rsquo;t move. I advanced towards them and yelled and we stared at each other. I looked down but couldn&rsquo;t find anything to throw.  The same coyote advanced again and the other one was coming at us from an angle so I shouted again. Then they ran off east towards the elementary school. These are the full grown version of the ones in the area that also went after a woman walking her dogs a block away at the Telus science centre last year. They have zero fear of people. They need to be relocated or euthanized. They will attack.,Night,28/01/2021,1,encounter,139st 109A ave

He seemed to be waiting, I let my dog into the yard (62 lbs Boxer cross) and went outside with him.  I have seen this coyote x4 now since Dec.  He runs along the fence line or the golf cart path on either side of hole 15.  There is 1 small 5 lb dog on one side of me and 2 houses down, another  7 lb dog.  That dog had just come inside no issues.  I always take two items.s I can throw at the fence or have used my shovel to bang on the deck before.  

Yesterday, my dog was in the yard.  I spoted the coyote and yelled at the coyote and he moved south and west closed to my dog.  The dog then saw him, barking as he ran across the yard to challenge him.  This coyote is huge!  I banged the deck several times and he moved closer.  Once my dog was challenging and barking at him.  I moved to the fence to pull my dog into the house.  And I stayed outside and continued to bang the deck, yelling at the coyote.  He was slow to retreat, east.  He continued to stop, stand and stay in place.  My neighbour had come out and turned on a bright light.  THe coyote then moved to the centre of the golf course.  Stayed and didn&#039;t move for quite a while.  Then further north, and then moved to the north side of path and exited through the &quot;gate&quot;, I believe.  

I have 3 other encounters, once, he was on the north side of hole 15.  He was beside a tree again, and came south towards my house and the path.  I banged my broom on the deck several times and shouted to him. He eventually left and exited west out the gate.

Another time since Christmas but around Christmas, he was running along the path.

Another time, same hole 15.  I could see his silhouette along the &quot;hill&quot; on the golf course across from my house.  The reflection is one the lit from  street lights and then he ran along the fence line in the north side of hole 15.

He is also known to have attacked a dog on the Lewis Estates golf course, I believe it was on hole 13.  There were 2 smaller coyotes with him(no idea of its a male or female, I always say him, when referring to the coyote).  They were nipping at the back of his legs of the off leash dog that was being walked by his female owner.  The owner had to fend off the three coyotes. 3rd hand story.",9:00 PM,23/02/2021,3,encounter,"Behind 729 Balfour Close, on Lewis Estates Golf course, hole 15"

I see coyotes often, and I am quite fascinated by them.  (I have 3 dogs and 2 cats so in the spirit of &quot;know your enemy&quot; I have done some research of my own.
I have started to note on my calendar which days, what time, and how many I see. (Just for fun.) Some coyotes I know by sight and I believe that I can recognize the females from the males.  I find their behaviour to be fascinating.
Last night there were 3 running around, chatting/yammering away in the green space across from me as well as on the neighbours front yard.  I have seen this same group of three (I think) on Friday at 3pm, trotting west down my street and into the ravine.  Friday is garbage day.  We definitely see higher numbers of coyotes on Thursday evenings and Fridays - they must know when it is garbage day!

I have had a few encounters in the four and a half years I have lived in this house.  I find that different coyotes have different reactions/personalities when face to face with people and dogs.  
Anyway, thanks for your project and your research.
If you ever want to chat about the den that lives in this area, I&#039;d be happy to talk.  thank you.",10:00 PM,27/02/2021,5,sighting,71 avenue and 85 street

I encountered 5 of them when I was on a walk today chasing each other back and forth across 127 St. going N on 127 street, cars had to stop so they wouldn&#039;t hit them, then they turned and headed East into the Neighbourhood on 15 Ave. SW. They walk right down our streets in daylight and in our yards at night. I see their tracks. They are also in the storm pond hiding in the reeds approx 18 Ave. SW &amp; 118. street.  I am worried about the children (Johnny Bright School) and the elderly out for walks not to mention small pet dogs with their owners.  It is getting to be very brazen on their part and I wasn&#039;t sure where to walk to get away from them and it made me feel uneasy as I am sure it is for the residents in Rutherford I would think.  Is there anyway to round them up and move them out of town, or is there too many of them.  They have been howling at night and they were howling today.  I believe they live in the brush adjacent to 127 st. in between 15 &amp; 20 Ave. Let me know if there is any kind of action to be taken before someone is accosted by more than one of them.

But last Wednesday, my husband was walking our dog and it was very quiet with few other people and dogs. A coyote came out of the woods and engaged with our (off-leash) dog, who then followed him into the trees. My husband was very concerned and called and called and finally, luckily, the dog returned. He put him on the leash immediately, but then the coyotes seemed to trail them along the path and they were howling and yipping their way along the bluffs. When my husband turned to return, there was a large coyote sitting in the middle of the path watching him and the dog approach. It didn&#039;t move, even after they got quite close, and my husband eventually had to mock charge at it and yell and wave until it slowly moved off into the trees. He was very shaken, both because of the initial encounter where he thought the dog was in danger, but also because of how brazen the coyote on the path had been. He wasn&#039;t entirely sure of how to deal with it, and whether he would antagonize it by yelling etc, but he also didn&#039;t want to have to go around it and have his back to it. 
Then, on Saturday March 6th, I was running the same path at 8:30am when we heard a horrible, very aggressive sounding pack howl (we&#039;ve often heard them howl and communicate along the path and across the river but this was completely different). It went on for about 2 mins, we actually stopped because it sounded so awful that we were concerned that we should maybe call someone. Then the group howl seemed to stop but there was an awful, wounded shrieking animal cry that followed - probably about 5 or 6 times, each lasting about 15-20 seconds. It was impossible to not believe that something had been attacked and injured - although whether a domestic pet or another wild animal we had no way of knowing. Again, it was quite disturbing and unsettling and has made us a lot more cautious about using the trail, especially when there are less people about. 
Sorry - I realize this is very long! The reality is, if we reported every sighting, we could write every day - but these last 2 experiences have made us more concerned and cautious and more eager to learn about how to keep ourselves and our dog safe, knowing that there are coyotes around, and wanting to share the space with them rather than eliminate them.

The coyote (~60 lbs) continued to approach us even though our dogs were vocal. We turned to walk on and the coyote followed us eastbound on 94 avenue. With our most stable dog (40 lbs) we ran toward the coyote while growling and shouting. It turned reluctantly back into the schoolyard.

I had seen them around 200ft away and as soon as I stopped they stopped and started to lay low.

I have never anything over a group of 2-3 coyotes together and it was scary as I understand they group up when they need to hunt (lack of food).

They were not aggressive to me however it scared me as a large number of coyotes together are a real threat.

This large coyote looked to be in good condition, like the pair I saw on Saturday. With no rabbits left, I&#039;m concerned that they will be bolder as they look for food. There are bushes near 34 Ave &amp; Calgary Trail where homeless people live in summer - I suspect the coyotes are living there.

At first I wasn&#039;t sure what I saw - they were the size of coyotes and thin but had speckled coats but no obviously bushy tail that I could see. It&#039;s been a few years since I&#039;ve seen a coyote but these were the right size and it&#039;s moulting season so those could have been tufts of hair on their coats. They were just walking along the side of the berm. There were no people around at the time (I could see them from my kitchen window) but the berm is a really popular walking trail for families, couples and singles, also for cyclists. The neighbourhood rabbit population is way down - I think I&#039;ve seen one rabbit this winter a block away. The coyotes looked to be in fairly good shape. There is a clump of trees at Calgary Trail &amp; 34 Ave. that homeless people use in summer and the coyotes were headed that way. The only entrance to our community (Steinhauer) is back in the direction they were travelling from, at a walkway into the community at 31 Ave and Calgary Trail, behind the South Edmonton Primary Care Centre (former A&amp;B Sound building). Not sure what the coyotes will eat with all the rabbits gone and the usual squirrels that run along my back fence haven&#039;t been around either. I&#039;m concerned because my 2 yr old granddaughter is here 1-2 times per week. I don&#039;t leave her unattended and my yard has a new fence with no gaps but they could get under the steel gate to the front of my property to get into the backyard. There is a toddler &amp; child living at 31 Ave  right across from the walkway to the berm from our community. Also concerned that a pair of coyotes may have pups and become defensive/protective of their young.

My dog quickened his pace through dip, pulling me in a hurry.  Once on service road there was a smallish coyote arched back, tail between legs and hissing. I yelled NO at it and picked up some gravel and threw it at it.  It trotted into the woods where I just came from.  Then I noticed another larger one to my left (not as close) coming towards me slowly.  I yelled NO and threw gravel again.  Not sure if I should continue down road as unsure how many and if the one on my left would follow me.  Went back through dip in woods quickly and looked back to see coyote in grass/path where I just went through. Apparently there are signs on one end of this path/road but not where I entered on the side street by Turvey Bend.  I spoke to locals who confirmed there must be a den 100 yards in from the access point.  Maybe some extra signs on both ends warning of active den and not to walk there would be good.

Definitely high pitched coyote and lower pitched dog sounds, and the dog was in pain. At 7:45 AM, I saw one coyote loping leisurely along the top of the berm behind my house. It was large but not the largest I&#039;d seen before. I grew up on a farm, but in 20 years never saw a coyote, even though we had them living by the dugout. My brother lives along Blackmud ravine and he&#039;s seen one in 30 years on their pathway. I&#039;ve seen 4 this spring so far during the day, so these coyotes here are not nocturnal anymore and the one this morning was bothering a neighbourhood dog. No one around here let&#039;s their dogs run free ever so it is disconcerting to see coyotes allowed to run free while dogs are not. I think the City is mistaken in it&#039;s belief that these coyotes are harmless. I have a new fence in my backyard and babysit my 3 year old granddaughter here every Monday. I can&#039;t take her out front to water the flowers because I am concerned about the coyotes. Again, it doesn&#039;t make sense to allow coyotes to run free in a city neighbourhood when dogs are not allowed to and there is less threat from dogs than coyotes. These coyotes are not behaving like wild coyotes that are nocturnal and leave humans alone.  ",8:00 AM,19/07/2021,1,sighting,Rear of 32A Ave. &amp; 104 Street NW

10645,7/19/2021 18:32,,,780-902-3335,Sharon Hawrelak,"Saw what appeared to be the same coyote as I reported this morning behind my property at 3207 104 St NW on the west side of the berm  this time. Definitely a female - she marked her territory squatting. I was out in my backyard with my 3 yr old granddaughter, and I made her go in the sunroom, then I started waving my arms and yelling at the coyote. It was halfway down the berm so it was in direct line of sight with me above the fence. The coyote just looked at me and kept marking it&#039;s territory and slowly continued on with walking south without any reaction. I suspect there are coyotes living in the clump of trees at 34 Ave &amp; Calgary Trail as I live very near there and the ones I&#039;ve seen in May and now were travelling north-south or south-north along the berm. That clump of trees is not big enough to provide a sustainable habitat, and I suggest that the trees be trimmed up to discourage their use of this site again given that any pups are likely weaned now. This female is the same or similar to the coyote I saw this morning after I heard a dog-coyote fight to the south of my property. I have a new fence with tight boards but I now wonder if coyote can jump or climb over a 6 foot fence. That&#039;s why I made my grandchild go into the sunroom, and then we went into the house. My neighbours have trees along most of their fence so they probably don&#039;t see as much as I do, although there are retired couples on both sides of me who spend more time in their backyards while I am working all day inside except Sat-Monday. It&#039;s odd that I saw this coyote today 2-1/2 hours after sunrise and at 1:50 pm at midday. It was not afraid of me when I yelled at it, waved my arms and ran towards it. This coyote also looked thinner than the ones I saw in May. ",2:00 PM,19/07/2021,1,sighting,32 Avenue &amp; 104 St NW

It appeared young and curious. I grabbed the dog into my arms, yelled at the coyote, stomped feet, but it wouldn&rsquo;t go away. Then I had to get close to the roadway to stay as far as possible from the coyote and asked the drivers to honk(using hand motion).One did and the coyote retreated into the shrubs but still stood there looking at us. After I yelled one more time, and the bicycle rider came by, the coyote hid and about 20 seconds later we saw it cross the 34th avenue, about 50 ft west from us. Person on a bicycle told me that they saw the same coyote from their vehicle once.

My 3 yr old granddaughter and I were playing in my glassed in sunroom in the backyard, and she didn&#039;t notice the coyote so I didn&#039;t want to alarm her. I would have pulled out the water hose but I didn&#039;t want my granddaughter to follow me into the yard in case the coyote jumped the fence. I hate having coyotes behind my place - I&#039;m terrified of dogs, let alone coyotes and a pack of five was seen by my next door neighbour this spring. I&#039;ve seen 2 huge ones before as well as several lone ones. Since the City is so gungho on making coyotes live here, are they going to offer us funding for deterrents like fence rollers? It&#039;s only a matter of time before they become aggressive with humans like they are in Vancouver. I am shocked that the new garbage bins don&#039;t have latches to deter coyotes and dogs from tipping them. It is a no brainer that the design the City chose will only attract them into our yards and we won&#039;t be safe on garbage day..

I saw a lone coyote in my backyard this morning! It appeared to be young. It was incredibly energetic and was jumping around from one of my gardens to the other. It could climb onto the gate for my garden and even onto the fence. It spent about 2-3 minutes in my yard looking around in my gardens. My garden currently has a vole problem and therefore has been attracting a lot of neighbourhood cats, but it seemed like the coyote was also looking for something in there. Unfortunately, I was unable to take a picture since I was absolutely unprepared and unexpecting a coyote in my backyard, and by the time I found my phone, it decided to leave. 

This is the first time I have seen a coyote in my backyard in 15 years. Last we ever saw a coyote was when this area was in the development process and we had no fences. However, two weeks ago, I found some scat in my backyard that resembled dog poop. At the time, I assumed it was a dog (even though we have never had a dog wander into our backyard), but after this sighting, I suspect it was probably a coyote. 

I will try to wake up earlier in the morning this week and keep an eye on my backyard. If it returns, I will be sure to take a picture for you!",8:00 AM,27/09/2021,1,sighting,"Backyard: 14039 136 street NW, Edmonton, Alberta T6V 1W8"

I could easily see them because of the freshly fallen snow. They were very quiet and calm, sometimes trotting, sometimes sniffing around and sometimes staying still and watching. I noticed that one had gotten inside the fencing that surrounds the newly made dry pond. I watched with my binoculars as the pair worked their way around the entire dry pond perimeter (one stuck inside, and the other following on the outside). Finally, the coyote inside the fenced off area scooched under the fence near the skating rink, and the pair made their way south again through the trees near the corner of 31 AVE and 106 Street where I lost sight of them. Coincidentally, at this same moment, a person was walking east along 31 AVE toward the place where the coyotes were going! I was even more surprised when I saw the person walk into the park right where the coyotes were a moment ago. I don&#039;t know if the person saw the coyotes or not. It seemed the person was trying to follow them, but that is just a hunch. I lost track of the coyotes, but I did see the person head south. The person crossed 31 Avenue and headed south behind the businesses on 106 street. Perhaps the coyotes went that way too? Interesting.",Night,17/11/2021,1,sighting,31 AVE and 106 STREET NW
