I moved to the fence to pull my dog into the house.  And I stayed outside and continued to bang the deck, yelling at the coyote.  He was slow to retreat, east.

I have started to note on my calendar which days, what time, and how many I see. (Just for fun.) Some coyotes I know by sight and I believe that I can recognize the females from the males.  I find their behaviour to be fascinating.
Last night there were 3 running around, chatting/yammering away in the green space across from me as well as on the neighbours front yard.  I have seen this same group of three (I think) on Friday at 3pm, trotting west down my street and into the ravine.  Friday is garbage day.  We definitely see higher numbers of coyotes on Thursday evenings and Fridays - they must know when it is garbage day!

I have had a few encounters in the four and a half years I have lived in this house.  I find that different coyotes have different reactions/personalities when face to face with people and dogs.  
Anyway, thanks for your project and your research.

But last Wednesday, my husband was walking our dog and it was very quiet with few other people and dogs. A coyote came out of the woods and engaged with our (off-leash) dog, who then followed him into the trees. My husband was very concerned and called and called and finally, luckily, the dog returned. He put him on the leash immediately, but then the coyotes seemed to trail them along the path and they were howling and yipping their way along the bluffs. When my husband turned to return, there was a large coyote sitting in the middle of the path watching him and the dog approach. It didn&#039;t move, even after they got quite close, and my husband eventually had to mock charge at it and yell and wave until it slowly moved off into the trees. He was very shaken, both because of the initial encounter where he thought the dog was in danger, but also because of how brazen the coyote on the path had been. He wasn&#039;t entirely sure of how to deal with it, and whether he would antagonize it by yelling etc, but he also didn&#039;t want to have to go around it and have his back to it. 
Then, on Saturday March 6th, I was running the same path at 8:30am when we heard a horrible, very aggressive sounding pack howl (we&#039;ve often heard them howl and communicate along the path and across the river but this was completely different). It went on for about 2 mins, we actually stopped because it sounded so awful that we were concerned that we should maybe call someone. Then the group howl seemed to stop but there was an awful, wounded shrieking animal cry that followed - probably about 5 or 6 times, each lasting about 15-20 seconds. It was impossible to not believe that something had been attacked and injured - although whether a domestic pet or another wild animal we had no way of knowing. Again, it was quite disturbing and unsettling and has made us a lot more cautious about using the trail, especially when there are less people about. 
Sorry - I realize this is very long! The reality is, if we reported every sighting, we could write every day - but these last 2 experiences have made us more concerned and cautious and more eager to learn about how to keep ourselves and our dog safe, knowing that there are coyotes around, and wanting to share the space with them rather than eliminate them.

At first I wasn&#039;t sure what I saw - they were the size of coyotes and thin but had speckled coats but no obviously bushy tail that I could see. It&#039;s been a few years since I&#039;ve seen a coyote but these were the right size and it&#039;s moulting season so those could have been tufts of hair on their coats. They were just walking along the side of the berm. There were no people around at the time (I could see them from my kitchen window) but the berm is a really popular walking trail for families, couples and singles, also for cyclists. The neighbourhood rabbit population is way down - I think I&#039;ve seen one rabbit this winter a block away. The coyotes looked to be in fairly good shape. There is a clump of trees at Calgary Trail &amp; 34 Ave. that homeless people use in summer and the coyotes were headed that way. The only entrance to our community (Steinhauer) is back in the direction they were travelling from, at a walkway into the community at 31 Ave and Calgary Trail, behind the South Edmonton Primary Care Centre (former A&amp;B Sound building). Not sure what the coyotes will eat with all the rabbits gone and the usual squirrels that run along my back fence haven&#039;t been around either. I&#039;m concerned because my 2 yr old granddaughter is here 1-2 times per week. I don&#039;t leave her unattended and my yard has a new fence with no gaps but they could get under the steel gate to the front of my property to get into the backyard. There is a toddler &amp; child living at 31 Ave  right across from the walkway to the berm from our community. Also concerned that a pair of coyotes may have pups and become defensive/protective of their young.

No one around here let&#039;s their dogs run free ever so it is disconcerting to see coyotes allowed to run free while dogs are not. I think the City is mistaken in it&#039;s belief that these coyotes are harmless. I have a new fence in my backyard and babysit my 3 year old granddaughter here every Monday. I can&#039;t take her out front to water the flowers because I am concerned about the coyotes. Again, it doesn&#039;t make sense to allow coyotes to run free in a city neighbourhood when dogs are not allowed to and there is less threat from dogs than coyotes. These coyotes are not behaving like wild coyotes that are nocturnal and leave humans alone.

Definitely a female - she marked her territory squatting. I was out in my backyard with my 3 yr old granddaughter, and I made her go in the sunroom, then I started waving my arms and yelling at the coyote. It was halfway down the berm so it was in direct line of sight with me above the fence. The coyote just looked at me and kept marking it&#039;s territory and slowly continued on with walking south without any reaction. I suspect there are coyotes living in the clump of trees at 34 Ave &amp; Calgary Trail as I live very near there and the ones I&#039;ve seen in May and now were travelling north-south or south-north along the berm. That clump of trees is not big enough to provide a sustainable habitat, and I suggest that the trees be trimmed up to discourage their use of this site again given that any pups are likely weaned now. This female is the same or similar to the coyote I saw this morning after I heard a dog-coyote fight to the south of my property. I have a new fence with tight boards but I now wonder if coyote can jump or climb over a 6 foot fence. That&#039;s why I made my grandchild go into the sunroom, and then we went into the house. My neighbours have trees along most of their fence so they probably don&#039;t see as much as I do, although there are retired couples on both sides of me who spend more time in their backyards while I am working all day inside except Sat-Monday. It&#039;s odd that I saw this coyote today 2-1/2 hours after sunrise and at 1:50 pm at midday. It was not afraid of me when I yelled at it, waved my arms and ran towards it. This coyote also looked thinner than the ones I saw in May. ","One (e.g., name 'a coyote' or single, lone)",Unknown,In home or yard,Child,Unknown,Yes,3.

I saw a lone coyote in my backyard this morning! It appeared to be young. It was incredibly energetic and was jumping around from one of my gardens to the other. It could climb onto the gate for my garden and even onto the fence. It spent about 2-3 minutes in my yard looking around in my gardens. My garden currently has a vole problem and therefore has been attracting a lot of neighbourhood cats, but it seemed like the coyote was also looking for something in there. Unfortunately, I was unable to take a picture since I was absolutely unprepared and unexpecting a coyote in my backyard, and by the time I found my phone, it decided to leave. 

This is the first time I have seen a coyote in my backyard in 15 years. Last we ever saw a coyote was when this area was in the development process and we had no fences. However, two weeks ago, I found some scat in my backyard that resembled dog poop. At the time, I assumed it was a dog (even though we have never had a dog wander into our backyard), but after this sighting, I suspect it was probably a coyote.

I watched with my binoculars as the pair worked their way around the entire dry pond perimeter (one stuck inside, and the other following on the outside). Finally, the coyote inside the fenced off area scooched under the fence near the skating rink, and the pair made their way south again through the trees near the corner of 31 AVE and 106 Street where I lost sight of them.
